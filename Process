We are performing this task which includes below Data Science stages:

• Data Understanding
• Data Preparation
• Data Modelling
• Model Evaluation
• Deployment

Data Understanding -

Import the data set in Python.
View the dataset
See the structure and the summary of the dataset to understand the data.
Find out the number of:
a.) Numeric attributes:
b.) Categorical attributes:

Data Preparation : Data Cleaning -

• Duplicate values: Identify if the datasets have duplicate values or not and remove the duplicate values.

Find out the number of rows present in the dataset

• Before removing duplicate values
• After removing duplicate values

• Variable type: Check if all the variables have the correct variable type, based on the data dictionary. If not, then change them.

For how many attributes did you need to change the data type?

• Missing value treatment: Check which variables have missing values and use appropriate treatments.

Data Preparation Feature Engineering: -
A - Feature Transformation:
1 - Identify variables that have non-linear trends.
2 - How many variables have non-linear trends?
3 - Transform them (as required)

B - Standardization:
Name the variables to be standardised before using a distance-based algorithm

C - Dummy encoding :
1- Identify the number of dummy variables to be created for the variable steel
