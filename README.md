# Melbourne-House-Data
#Description

Melbourne is currently experiencing a housing bubble (some experts say it may burst soon). Maybe someone can find a trend or give a prediction? Which suburbs are the best to buy in? Which ones are value for money? Where’s the expensive side of town? Which area is best to buy house in? And more importantly where should I buy a 2 bedroom unit?
